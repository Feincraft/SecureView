# SecureView
SecureView is a Power Apps demonstration solution for Continuous Authentication.

💡Don't let anyone access your sensitive data! 🔒 With this #PowerApps solution, you can implement #ContinuousAuthentication using #AI🤖 to keep data secure even if your phone is stolen while unlocked.

🤔 With Continuous Authentication your identity is verified throughout the entire session, minimizing potential threat in real time. This can be done with #biometrics, behavioral analysis, and other methods. My example uses #Azure FaceAPI and the device's camera to verify the user, on top of all the other #AzureAD / #Intune security measures.

💼 Who is this for? If you have enterprise mobile apps that display sensitive data, make sure that only you can look at it. Someone stole your phone while it was unlocked? they will be prevented from seeing that data. The same method can even be used to detect people looking over your shoulder.
