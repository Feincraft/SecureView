# SecureView
SecureView is a demonstration solution for Continuos Authorization.
Continuous authentication is the process of constantly verifying a user's identity throughout their session. 
It's an advanced security measure that ensures only the authorized user is accessing sensitive information or performing actions on a system. 
With continuous authentication, there are no longer one-time login credentials or single-factor authentication methods, which can be easily compromised. 
Instead, this method utilizes biometrics and behavioral analysis to establish and maintain trust during a user's entire session. This not only provides enhanced security but also improves the user experience by eliminating the need for repeated logins or interruptions.

In this example, a camera is used to continuously track the user and Azure Face API to verify the user's identity.
